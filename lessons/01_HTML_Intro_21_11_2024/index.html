      <strong>Elephantidea</strong> is a family of large, herbivorous
      proboscidean mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths. These are
      large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth
      modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct.
      Only two genera,

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant" target="_blank"
        ><em>Loxodonta</em>
        </a>

      (African elephants) and

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephas" target="_blank"
        ><em>Elephas</em>
        </a>

      (Asian elephants), are living. The family was first described by John
      Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within order
      Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to include
      or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera.
